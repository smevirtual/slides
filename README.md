## Slide Decks

This repository contains slide decks and other written material for events
that are not associated with a specific workshop, walkthrough or webinar
series.

Materials for specific events (e.g. workshops/walkthroughs or
presentations with source code) will be contained within a separate, dedicated
repository within the [SME Virtual Network Organization](https://github.com/smevirtual).

### Prerequisites

If you are modifying this project, you will need Git LFS installed
on your local machine to successfully commit a change.

Git Large File Storage (or Git LFS) allows large binary assets like media source files to be managed by Git.

See [this page](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for installation instructions. If you are on macOS, installing via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended.

### Install Git LFS

Git commit hooks must be installed by Git LFS on a freshly cloned repository.
This only has to be done once after a fresh clone.

Run the following in the repository root:

```bash
git lfs install
```

After this command completes, the Git hooks will be successfully installed.

### SME Logos and Branding Restrictions

The [SME](http://www.sme.org/) logos and brands which are part of the
files in this repository are not licensed for use outside of SME activities. SME
logo and brand usage is only allowed by the SME and authorized parties connected
to the SME (e.g. like regional chapters).

If you fork this project for use in some context not related to the SME, you
must not use SME logos or brands inappropriately. This means that you are free to
modify the files in this repository, but you must remove all SME logos
and brands. Please see the [SME Branding Guidelines](http://www.sme.org/sme-logo/)
for when a SME logo can be used and what conditions are attached to SME logos and brands.
